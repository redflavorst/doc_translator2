Let me check each part:\n\n- Adriana ‚Üí ÏïÑÎìúÎ¶¨ÏïÑÎÇò\n- Josefina ‚Üí Ï°∞ÏÑ∏ÌïÄÏù¥ÎÇò (I think that's the common transliteration)\n- Alvins ‚Üí ÏïåÎπàÏä§ (maybe \"Alvins\" is a surname, so I'll keep it as is)\n- Santi ‚Üí ÏÇ∞Ìã∞ (or maybe \"Santi\" could be a nickname, but I'll go with the direct translation)\n\nSo putting the name together: ÏïÑÎìúÎ¶¨ÏïÑÎÇò Ï°∞ÏÑ∏ÌïÄÏù¥ÎÇò ÏïåÎπàÏä§ ÏÇ∞Ìã∞\n\nNow, the \"(joint signer)\" part.

Let me check if there's a standard way to handle compound surnames or given names. Since the original has \"Alvins Santi\" as part of the name, maybe it's better to keep them separate. So the full translation would be: ÏïÑÎìúÎ¶¨ÏïÑÎÇò Ï°∞ÏÑ∏ÌïÄÏù¥ÎÇò ÏïåÎπàÏä§ ÏÇ∞Ìã∞ (Í≥µÎèô ÏÑúÎ™ÖÏûê)\n\nI think that's accurate.

Now, \"(joint signer)\" translates to something like \"Í≥µÎèô ÏÑúÎ™ÖÏûê\" in Korean. Let me check if that's correct. Yes, \"Í≥µÎèô\" means joint or shared, and \"ÏÑúÎ™ÖÏûê\" is signer. So putting it all together: Eugenio Federico Bluthgen (Í≥µÎèô ÏÑúÎ™ÖÏûê). Wait, should the parentheses be used? In Korean, sometimes they use parentheses for additional info, so that's fine.

It might be a typo for \"siger\" which could be \"siger\" as in a term from a specific context, like a title or a name. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be \"siger\" as in a Scandinavian term, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, names can be tricky because they often don't have direct translations. Proper nouns like personal names usually stay the same, but sometimes they are adapted phonetically or using a transliteration system. In Korean, foreign names are typically written using Hangul, which represents sounds from the original language.\n\n\"Dieter\" is a German name, and in Korean, it's commonly transliterated as \"ÎîîÌÑ∞\". Let me check if there's a standard way to write this. Yes, I think \"ÎîîÌÑ∞\" is correct for Dieter.\n\nNext, \"Van den Brande\". This part is a bit more complex. \"Van den\" is a Dutch or German preposition meaning \"of the\", and \"Brande\" is the surname. In Korean, when transliterating such names, each part is usually converted phonetically. \n\n\"Van den\" would be \"Î∞òÎç¥\" in Hangul. However, sometimes \"van den\" might be written as \"Î∞òÎç¥\" or \"Î∞òÎì†\". Wait, but I should check if there's a standard for this. For example, the Dutch surname \"Van den Brande\" is often transliterated as \"Î∞òÎç¥Î∏åÎûÄÎìú\" in Korean. Let me confirm that.\n\nBreaking it down: \"Van den\" becomes \"Î∞òÎç¥\", and \"Brande\" becomes \"Î∏åÎûÄÎìú\". So combining them, it would be \"Î∞òÎç¥Î∏åÎûÄÎìú\". \n\nPutting it all together with the first name: \"ÎîîÌÑ∞ Î∞òÎç¥Î∏åÎûÄÎìú\". But wait, in Korean names, sometimes the structure is different. Wait, no, for foreign names, the order remains the same as the original. So Dieter Van den Brande would be \"ÎîîÌÑ∞ Î∞òÎç¥Î∏åÎûÄÎìú\" or maybe \"ÎîîÌÑ∞ Î∞òÎì†Î∏åÎûÄÎìú\"? Hmm.\n\nWait, I should check if there's a standard transliteration for this specific name. Maybe looking up examples. For instance, if someone has the Dutch surname \"Van den Brande\", how is it written in Korean? \n\nI think the correct way would be to write each part phonetically. \"Van den\" as \"Î∞òÎç¥\" and \"Brande\" as \"Î∏åÎûÄÎìú\". So combining them, it's \"Î∞òÎç¥Î∏åÎûÄÎìú\". Therefore, the full name would be \"ÎîîÌÑ∞ Î∞òÎç¥Î∏åÎûÄÎìú\".\n\nAlternatively, sometimes \"van den\" might be written as \"Î∞òÎì†\", but I think \"Î∞òÎç¥\" is more accurate. Let me make sure. The Dutch pronunciation of \"Van den\" is similar to \"VAN DEN\", so in Korean, it's usually transliterated as \"Î∞òÎç¥\". \n\nSo the final translation should be \"ÎîîÌÑ∞ Î∞òÎç¥Î∏åÎûÄÎìú\".\n</think>\n\nÎîîÌÑ∞ Î∞òÎç¥Î∏åÎûÄÎìú",

The first part is \"Ana Beatriz,\" which are typically Spanish or Portuguese names. In Korean, when transliterating foreign names, we usually use Hangul characters that sound similar.\n\nFirst, \"Ana\" would be ÏïàÎÇò (Anna). Then \"Beatriz\" ‚Äì I need to make sure I get the pronunciation right. \"Beatriz\" is pronounced like \"Bey-ah-trees.\" In Korean, this might be written as ÎπÑÏóêÌä∏Î¶¨Ïä§ (Bi-eutris) or maybe ÎπÑÏóêÌä∏Î¶¨Ï¶à (Bi-eutrise)? Wait, sometimes the 'z' at the end can be tricky. Let me check if there's a standard way to transliterate \"Beatriz\" into Korean. Maybe it's more common to use ÎπÑÏóêÌä∏Î¶¨Ïä§. \n\nNext is the surname \"Requiao Franco.\" Let's take \"Requiao\" first. The pronunciation is similar to \"Ree-kyoh-oh.\" In Hangul, that would be Î†àÌÄ¥Ïò§ (Reu-gio) or maybe Î†àÌÅêÏïÑÏò§ (Reo-kyo-oh)? Wait, the correct transliteration might depend on how it's commonly written. Sometimes, \"Requiao\" could be Î†àÌÄ¥Ïò§ or Î†àÌÅêÏïÑÏò§. Let me think. The 'qu' sound in Portuguese is like a 'k' followed by a 'w' sound, so maybe Î†àÌÅêÏïÑÏò§ (Reo-kyo-oh) would be more accurate. \n\nThen \"Franco\" ‚Äì that's straightforward. In Korean, it's ÌîÑÎûëÏΩî (Pyeongko). But wait, sometimes \"Franco\" is written as ÌîÑÎûÄÏΩî (Pyeonko), but I think the common transliteration might be ÌîÑÎûëÏΩî. Let me confirm. For example, the surname Franco in Spanish or Portuguese would typically be translated to ÌîÑÎûëÏΩî in Korean. \n\nPutting it all together: Ana Beatriz Requiao Franco becomes ÏïàÎÇò ÎπÑÏóêÌä∏Î¶¨Ïä§ Î†àÌÅêÏïÑÏò§ ÌîÑÎûëÏΩî. Wait, but sometimes surnames are written with a space between the first and last name. Let me check if \"Requiao Franco\" is a single surname or two parts. If it's two separate names, maybe it should be Î†àÌÄ¥Ïò§ ÌîÑÎûëÏΩî. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the full name is Ana Beatriz Requiao Franco, so all parts are part of the full name. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes in Korean translations, they might use a different approach for Portuguese names. For example, \"Requiao\" could be Î†àÌÄ¥Ïò§ and \"Franco\" as ÌîÑÎûëÏΩî. So combining everything: ÏïàÎÇò ÎπÑÏóêÌä∏Î¶¨Ïä§ Î†àÌÄ¥Ïò§ ÌîÑÎûëÏΩî. But I need to make sure about the correct transliteration of each part. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that in Korean, sometimes the order might be adjusted for pronunciation. For example, \"Beatriz\" could be written as ÎπÑÏóêÌä∏Î¶¨Ïä§ or ÎπÑÏóêÌä∏Î¶¨Ï¶à. Let me check if there's a standard. Maybe looking up similar names would help, but since I can't do that right now, I'll go with my best judgment. \n\nSo final translation: ÏïàÎÇò ÎπÑÏóêÌä∏Î¶¨Ïä§ Î†àÌÅêÏïÑÏò§ ÌîÑÎûëÏΩî. Alternatively, maybe Î†àÌÄ¥Ïò§ instead of Î†àÌÅêÏïÑÏò§? Hmm. The 'qu' in Portuguese is pronounced like a 'k' followed by a 'w', so \"Requiao\" would be Î†àÌÅêÏïÑÏò§ (Reo-kyo-oh). But sometimes it might be simplified to Î†àÌÄ¥Ïò§. I think the correct transliteration would be Î†àÌÅêÏïÑÏò§. \n\nTherefore, the full name in Korean is ÏïàÎÇò ÎπÑÏóêÌä∏Î¶¨Ïä§ Î†àÌÅêÏïÑÏò§ ÌîÑÎûëÏΩî.\n</think>\n\nÏïàÎÇò ÎπÑÏóêÌä∏Î¶¨Ïä§ Î†àÌÅêÏïÑÏò§ ÌîÑÎûëÏΩî",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, names are usually transliterated rather than translated. So I should convert each part of the name into its Korean equivalent. \n\nStarting with \"Gustavo\". In Korean, this is typically written as 'Íµ¨Ïä§ÌÉÄÎ≥¥'. The pronunciation is similar, so that's straightforward.\n\nNext is \"Gerardo\". This might be a bit trickier. The common transliteration for Gerardo in Korean is 'Ï†úÎùºÎ•¥ÎèÑ' or sometimes 'Ï†úÎùºÎ•¥ÎèÑ'. I should check if there's a standard way to write this name. Since it's a Spanish name, the Korean transliteration would follow the phonetic rules. So \"Gerardo\" becomes 'Ï†úÎùºÎ•¥ÎèÑ'.\n\nThen there's \"Schmidt\". This is a German surname. In Korean, it's commonly written as 'ÏäàÎØ∏Ìä∏'. The 'Sch' at the beginning is usually transliterated as 'Ïäà', and 'midt' becomes 'ÎØ∏Ìä∏'. \n\nPutting them all together: Gustavo Gerardo Schmidt would be 'Íµ¨Ïä§ÌÉÄÎ≥¥ Ï†úÎùºÎ•¥ÎèÑ ÏäàÎØ∏Ìä∏'. I should make sure there are no spaces between the parts, as Korean names typically don't have spaces. Also, check if any of the parts might have alternative spellings, but I think these are standard. \n\nWait, sometimes in Korean, the order might be different, but since it's a name with three parts, each part should remain separate. So the final translation is 'Íµ¨Ïä§ÌÉÄÎ≥¥ Ï†úÎùºÎ•¥ÎèÑ ÏäàÎØ∏Ìä∏'.\n</think>\n\nÍµ¨Ïä§ÌÉÄÎ≥¥ Ï†úÎùºÎ•¥ÎèÑ ÏäàÎØ∏Ìä∏",
  "64bbef96ae4810fd48886dceb1e245520ca83ddd": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate \"Kimberly-Clark Finance CanadaULC\" into Korean. Let me start by breaking down the components.\n\nFirst, \"Kimberly-Clark\" is a proper noun, so it should stay as is in Korean. Sometimes companies keep their original names, but maybe they have a registered Korean name. I'm not sure, so I'll assume it's kept the same.\n\nNext is \"Finance\". In Korean, that's \"Í∏àÏúµ\" (gimyeong). So \"Finance CanadaULC\" becomes \"Ï∫êÎÇòÎã§ ULC Í∏àÏúµ\".\n\nWait, \"CanadaULC\" ‚Äì what does ULC stand for? It might be a legal structure. In some countries, ULC stands for Unlimited Liability Company. But in Korean, they might just transliterate it as \"ULC\". So \"CanadaULC\" would be \"Ï∫êÎÇòÎã§ ULC\".\n\nPutting it all together: \"Kimberly-Clark Finance CanadaULC\" becomes \"ÌÇ¥Î≤åÎ¶¨-ÌÅ¥ÎùºÌÅ¨ Í∏àÏúµ Ï∫êÎÇòÎã§ ULC\". \n\nWait, should the company name be in Korean characters? Sometimes they use Hangul for the main name but keep the original for subsidiaries. Let me check if there's an official Korean name for Kimberly-Clark Finance CanadaULC. If not, I'll stick with the transliteration.\n\nSo final translation: \"ÌÇ¥Î≤åÎ¶¨-ÌÅ¥ÎùºÌÅ¨ Í∏àÏúµ Ï∫êÎÇòÎã§ ULC\". That should be it.\n</think>\n\nÌÇ¥Î≤åÎ¶¨-ÌÅ¥ÎùºÌÅ¨ Í∏àÏúµ Ï∫êÎÇòÎã§ ULC",
  "e686e94ac455eb5d7477d759cbc49734fa350c0e": "<think>\nOkay, I need to translate \"Cristina Garcia (joint signer)\" into Korean. Let's start with the names. \"Cristina Garcia\" is a proper noun, so it should stay the same in Korean, but sometimes Korean transliterates Spanish names. Let me check: Cristina is usually written as ÌÅ¨Î¶¨Ïä§Ìã∞ÎÇò and Garcia as Í∞ÄÎ•¥ÏãúÏïÑ. So together, it would be ÌÅ¨Î¶¨Ïä§Ìã∞ÎÇò Í∞ÄÎ•¥ÏãúÏïÑ.\n\nNow, the part in parentheses: \"(joint signer)\". \"Joint\" here means shared or co-signed, so the term for joint signer in Korean could be Í≥µÎèô ÏÑúÎ™ÖÏûê. Let me confirm that. Yes, \"Í≥µÎèô ÏÑúÎ™ÖÏûê\" is correct for joint signer. \n\nPutting it all together: \"ÌÅ¨Î¶¨Ïä§Ìã∞ÎÇò Í∞ÄÎ•¥ÏãúÏïÑ (Í≥µÎèô ÏÑúÎ™ÖÏûê)\". Wait, should there be a space between the name and the parentheses? In Korean, sometimes they don't use spaces, but in this case, since it's a title or label, maybe including a space is better. Let me check examples. For instance, in official documents, names followed by titles often have a space. So \"ÌÅ¨Î¶¨Ïä§Ìã∞ÎÇò Í∞ÄÎ•¥ÏãúÏïÑ (Í≥µÎèô ÏÑúÎ™ÖÏûê)\" seems correct.\n\nDouble-checking the translation: Cristina Garcia is the name, and joint signer is Í≥µÎèô ÏÑúÎ™ÖÏûê. Yes, that's accurate. No need for any additional explanations, just the translated text as requested.\n</think>\n\nÌÅ¨Î¶¨Ïä§Ìã∞ÎÇò Í∞ÄÎ•¥ÏãúÏïÑ (Í≥µÎèô ÏÑúÎ™ÖÏûê)",
